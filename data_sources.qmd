IR data sources

## Intervention data

MAP data for 2015 and 2020 via the `malariaAtlas` R package (github version)
```
irpreds::get_intervention(
  intervention = c("itn", "irs"),
  year = c(2020, 2015)
)
# via
malariaAtlas::getRaster()
```

## Crop data
Originally from [https://harvestchoice.org/data/]() now housed at
[https://www.ifpri.org/project/harvestchoice]() with data at:

#### Global Spatially-Disaggregated Crop Production Statistics

Using the `_P_` (production) variables for `_A` (total area) technology layers
(NB: consider using irrigated + high inputs as tighter proxy for pestecide use?)
```
v: Variables
**************
*_A_*		physical area
*_H_*		harvested area
*_P_*		production
*_Y_*		yield
*_V_agg_*	value of production, aggregated to all crops, food and non-food (see below)

t: Technologies
******************
*_TA	all technologies together, ie complete crop
*_TI	irrigated portion of crop
*_TH	rainfed high inputs portion of crop
*_TL	rainfed low inputs portion of crop
*_TS	rainfed subsistence portion of crop
*_TR	rainfed portion of crop (= TA - TI, or TH + TL + TS)
```
